### âœ… COMPLETE: Renamed /setup to /setuphero and removed unwanted commands (auth, start-dh, marketplace, ch)
- Removed /auth, /start-dh, /marketplace, /ch commands from index.js registration
- Renamed setup.js to setuphero.js and updated imports
- System now has cleaner command list for admins

### âœ… COMPLETE: Updated /admin to remove promotional weapons for regular admins (Bot Dev only)

  - quest.js, create-quest.js, manage-quest.js, quest-rewards.js, dm.js
- Quest system now Bot Developer only as requested
- Consistent access denied embeds for unauthorized users

### âœ… COMPLETE: Slash command cleanup finished - Ready for clean admin testing experience
- Reduced from 17 to 13 total slash commands
- 5 visible to everyone: /setuphero, /embed, /profile, /chsave, /chload
- 8 Bot Dev only: /master, /admin, /quest, /create-quest, /manage-quest, /quest-rewards, /reset-master, /dm
- 4 completely removed: /auth, /start-dh, /marketplace, /ch

### âœ… COMPLETE: Simplified /master and /setuphero to direct flows as specified - Fixed ALL import issues
- Removed all subcommands from both /master and /setuphero
- /master: Direct flow â†’ authentication â†’ Master Dashboard in current channel (hidden from others)
- /setuphero: Direct flow â†’ authentication â†’ Admin Dashboard â†’ choose Start Here placement
- Fixed setuphero.js file naming issue that was causing import errors

### âœ… COMPLETE: Fixed dashboard interactions blocked by game state checks - All dashboard/authentication flows now bypass game state requirements
- Added all dashboard authentication interactions to profileInteractions array: admin_create_profile, admin_login, player_create_profile, player_login, bot_dev_authenticate, player_auth_password, player_smart_login
- Created new dashboardInteractions array with all dashboard navigation: admin_dashboard_main, player_dashboard_main, bot_dev_dashboard_main, master_dashboard_main, tutorial/help interactions, setup interactions
- Updated skipGameState logic to include isDashboardInteraction
- All dashboard/authentication flows now work without requiring active game sessions
- Fixed the core issue preventing dashboard system from working

### âœ… COMPLETE: Inverted game state logic to clean approach - Only actual gameplay interactions require game state, everything else works freely
- MASSIVE CLEANUP: Removed hundreds of exemption-based interaction arrays (marketplaceInteractions, masterInteractions, profileInteractions, permanentEmbedInteractions, dashboardInteractions, casinoInteractions, etc.)
- Replaced complex "block everything, then exempt" logic with simple "only require for gameplay" approach
- New clean logic: Only combat, dungeon navigation, and adventure actions need game state
- All authentication, dashboards, admin tools, marketplace, social features, help systems now work without game state by default
- Eliminated maintenance nightmare of manually adding every new interaction to exemption lists
- Cleaner, more logical, and future-proof approach
- Reduced code complexity from ~200 exempted interactions to ~15 gameplay interactions that need state

### âœ… COMPLETE: Fixed ALL missing handler methods AND modal submission handlers to prevent error cascade
- FIXED ROUTING: admin_auth_password and admin_forgot_password now routed to DashboardEmbedHandler.handleAdminStartHere instead of non-existent AdminHandler.handleAdminProfileCreation
- FIXED ROUTING: bot_dev_authenticate now routed to BotDeveloperHandler.showMasterAuthentication instead of non-existent DashboardEmbedHandler.handleBotDevAuthentication
- ADDED: Missing authentication cases to DashboardEmbedHandler.handleAdminStartHere method (admin_auth_password, admin_forgot_password)
- ADDED: Missing authentication handler methods (handleAdminPasswordAuth, handleAdminForgotPassword) to DashboardEmbedHandler
- ADDED TO AdminHandler: showPasswordModal, showQuestManagement, showPlayerManagement, showServerAnalytics, showServerSettings methods
- ADDED TO UserProfileHandler: showPasswordModal, handlePasswordSubmission, and authenticatePlayer methods for complete player authentication
- ADDED TO ProfileHandler: showProfile wrapper method that calls existing showPlayerProfile
- ADDED TO CommandHandler: Modal submission cases for admin_password_modal and player_password_modal in handleModalSubmission method
- VERIFIED: All BotDeveloperHandler methods (showSystemManagement, showEconomyTools, showGameManagement, showUserManagement, showAnalytics, showDeveloperTools) already exist
- REMOVED: Broken duplicate routing sections that called non-existent methods
- All dashboard authentication flows now properly connected and functional end-to-end
- PREVENTED: The cascade of "function is not a function" errors that would have occurred at every menu option
- ELIMINATED: "AdminHandler.showPasswordModal is not a function", "Unknown modal submission: admin_password_modal", and all similar missing method errors
- FIXED: The original issue where password modal displayed but submission failed with "Unknown modal submission" error
